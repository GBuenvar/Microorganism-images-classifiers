In particular, we have trained a model to classify Phytoplankton species. We have worked with three classes, Diatoms, Dinoflagelates and Chlamy. If needed, it shuold be easy to adapt the code, following the comments, to change the number of species to consider, or even changing complitely the aim of the classificator. The model used is YOLOv4, which is an object detection algorithm writen in a particular deepleaerning framework out of the standard TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries, called darknet. This framework was created by the author of the YOLOv4 algorithm, and as an independent library, it should be unchanged, so this script should work for longer time without compatibility problems, even some performance loss.\n","\n","You can find more information about the YOLO family and the object detection algorithms in their github [https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) and in pages as RoboFlow. \n","\n","This notebook has been adapted from the RoboFlow training notebook for YOLOv4, and adapted to researchers out of the field of deeplearning that just want an easy way to train similar models than the one I trained.
